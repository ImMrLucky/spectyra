# Terms of Service Warning

## Important Notice

**Using this extension may violate ChatGPT's Terms of Service.**

ChatGPT and other LLM providers may prohibit:
- Browser extensions that modify their API calls
- Third-party services that intercept requests
- Automated tools that alter request/response flow

## Risks

1. **Account Suspension**: ChatGPT may suspend or ban accounts using extensions
2. **Service Disruption**: The extension may break if ChatGPT changes their API
3. **Detection**: ChatGPT may detect the extension and take action

## Mitigation

The extension includes stealth features to minimize detection:
- ✅ No console logs in production mode
- ✅ Minimal window properties
- ✅ Response format matching
- ✅ No detectable API key exposure

However, **detection is still possible** if ChatGPT actively checks for extensions.

## Recommendation

**Use at your own risk.** Consider:
- Using a separate/test account
- Monitoring for account issues
- Being aware that detection is possible
- Understanding that this may violate ToS

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for:
- Understanding the risks
- Complying with provider Terms of Service
- Using the extension at their own discretion
- Not holding Spectyra liable for account issues

## Legal Disclaimer

This extension is provided "as-is" without warranty. Users assume all risks associated with using this extension, including potential violations of third-party Terms of Service.
